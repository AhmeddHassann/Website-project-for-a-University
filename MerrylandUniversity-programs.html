            <p>The Gies accountancy major combines technical knowledge in accounting, assurance, taxation, and data analytics with professional competencies in critical thinking, communication, leadership, and strategic decision-making. Accountancy majors will study the principles, concepts, and methods used to record and report the transactions and activities of a business entity, as well as the tools and processes to audit and analyze accounting information. Accountancy majors will also study the role of accounting information in shaping and implementing key business strategies. Career opportunities for accountancy majors include positions in audit and assurance services, corporate accounting, taxation, consulting and advisory services, and in governmental and not-for-profit entities.
              In addition to the accountancy major requirements,
               students in accountancy must meet the University General Education requirements and the College of Business core requirements.</p>

            <p>Engineering is a multifaceted discipline that over the last century has produced an astounding progression of technological innovations that have shaped virtually every aspect of modern life. Electrical engineers need a broad and solid foundation in mathematics and physics to support their education in the engineering principles of analysis, synthesis, design, implementation, and testing of the devices and systems that provide the bedrock of modern energy, communication, sensing, computing, medical, security, and defense infrastructures. Within each subdiscipline one can find application domains that strongly rely on hands-on experimental work or that are based on theoretical, mathematical and computational approaches. The multidisciplinary nature of the electrical engineering education addresses the growing demand for the innovation and design of sensing, communication, computing, and decision-making systems of increasing complexity in consumer, defense, and medical applications.

The curriculum starts with a core of fundamental courses on circuits, electromagnetics, solid-state electronics, and computer systems, leading to a comprehensive array of specialized courses and laboratories in all of the important areas of modern electrical engineering. </p>

          <p>The Computer Science curriculum provides both a broad and deep knowledge of the theory, design, and application of computer systems, with an emphasis on software systems. Because computing is ubiquitous, application areas involve virtually any field imaginable - from developing gene sequencing algorithms via techniques in computational biology, to designing user interfaces for mobile applications; from designing methods for high frequency trading, to creating computer generated graphics and special effects in the gaming industry; and from creating embedded real time systems to be deployed in medical devices, to analyzing social data from internet communication patterns. During the first two years the curriculum provides a strong foundation in mathematics, science, and computation. Advanced coursework in areas of the student's choosing follows in the second two years, which include either a senior thesis or a senior project. Graduates may go on to graduate study or leading positions in industry.

A combined B.S.-M.S. Computer Science degree program is available. The admission and course requirements are described on the Computer Science website.</p>

            <p>The field of finance is primarily concerned with the acquisition and management of funds by business firms, governments, and individuals. A business seeks financial advice when considering the purchase of new equipment, the expansion of present facilities, or the raising of additional funds. Determining the value of financial and real assets and derivatives is a key activity in finance.
As the study of finance is designed to provide the student with both the theoretical background and the analytical tools required to make effective judgments in finance, many students select careers in business financial management, commercial and investment banking, investments, government finance, insurance, and real estate.In addition to the finance major requirements, students in finance must meet the University General Education requirements and the Gies College of Business core requirements.</p>
